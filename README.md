# Using Machine Learning to Classify Emotional Valence and Language in Bilinguals

## Participants
25-30 Dutch-English University of Groningen bilingual students will be recruited to participate in this experiment. The participants will be right-handed, with (corrected to) normal vision and no disorders that could severely inconvene and affect thir task performance. 
Subjects will be compensated with money for the time spent participating in this experiment. 

## Stimuli
Reproducing the design by Hsu (2015), this paper likewise uses texts across all seven Harry Potter novels; the stimuli took form of short passages, roughly 4 lines in length. Those texts would fall into one of the three broad emotional conditions: 1) positive; 2) neutral; 3) negative.
120 passages were chosen, 40 for each of the aforementioned emotions. 

## Design
The experiment's design was a 3x2 matrix: _emotional condition_ (positive/neutral/negative) x _language_ (English/Dutch) respectively. Furthermore, the passages were split into two subsets of 60, each half the size of the total number of stimuli. Within each subset, each emotion was equally present (20x3). The subsets were used in such a manner that, during the experiment, a subject read one subset in, e.g., English, and the other in Dutch.

## Procedure
The experiment consisted of four blocks, each containing 30 stimuli. Within a block, each combination of _emotion_ and _language_ were presented 5 times (5x6). The order in which the passages were presented were pseudo-randomised each block. However, a slight change has been made in comparison to the original experiment. Hsu (2015) ensured that each possible language switch combination (E-E, E-G, G-E, G-G) occurred equal number (7) of times within a block; this sequence excluded the first and last trials per block. When reproducing the experiment, it was difficult to find a method that would ensure the same equality of occurrences for each possible language switch. To compromise, 4 sequences (one for each block) were generated in such a manner that each switch would have one fewer instance, as follows: 6-7-7-7, 7-6,7-7, 7-7-6-7, and 7-7-7-6 for E-E, E-D, D-E, and D-D respectively. The order in which those sequences were used was randomised for each participant. Similarly, the distribution of the valences was not balanced the same way as in the original experiment, being more random instead.

Aside from the aforementioned change, the remaining design largely follows the original setup: each stimulus was presented for 14s, split over 4 lines, giving 3.5s for each line's presentation. This was followed by a brief gap of 0.5s, where nothing has been shown. The gap was introduced to create space between presenting either the fixation or a trivia question. If the former was shown, the subjects would see a fixation cross for 14s, after which another stimulus was presented. The latter (trivia) was shown every 7 trials, with the intention to check that participant were paying attention. The chosen frequency ensured that the total number of questions was 16 across the entire experiment (4 four per block), similar to the experiment being reproduced. Those emotion-unrelated trivia followed a yes/no format and were about the contents of the just-presented passage (e.g., "Did Harry raise the wand above his head?"). The subjects responsed to the questions via button press.
