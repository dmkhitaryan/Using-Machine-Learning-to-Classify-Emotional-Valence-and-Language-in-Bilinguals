# Using Machine Learning to Classify Emotional Valence and Language in Bilinguals

## Participants
25-30 Dutch-English University of Groningen bilingual students will be recruited to participate in this experiment. The participants will be right-handed, with (corrected to) normal vision and no disorders that could severely inconvene and affect thir task performance. 
Subjects will be compensated with money for the time spent participating in this experiment. 

## Stimuli
Reproducing the design by Hsu (2015), this paper likewise uses texts across all seven Harry Potter novels; the stimuli took form of short passages, roughly 4 lines in length. Those texts would fall into one of the three broad emotional conditions: 1) positive; 2) neutral; 3) negative.
120 passages were chosen, 40 for each of the aforementioned emotions. 

## Design
The experiment's design was a 3x2 matrix: _emotional condition_ (positive/neutral/negative) x _language_ (English/Dutch) respectively. Furthermore, the passages were split into two subsets of 60, each half the size of the total number of stimuli. Within each subset, each emotion was equally present (20x3). The subsets were used in such a manner that, during the experiment, a subject read one subset in, e.g., English, and the other in Dutch.
